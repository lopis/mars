# Planet B <sup>alpha</sup>

We fucked up. Earth is dead. Time for planet B.

We carbon-creditted our environment to death. We let AI make all decisions. We out-farmmed ourselves out of arable land. Our sky is full of space junk. The water, the ice, the heat and the cold are all in the wrong places and most people are dying.

Somehow in the last years the world governments managed to put aside their differences and join forces to move Humanity to mars. The ultra rich wanted it all for themselves until they realized you can't run a city with just CEOs.

## Game mechanics

In this glocal co-op game you're one of Mars' managers.
Any number of players can join simultaneously to help deal with every day tasks like:

- Welcome refugee ships and assign them housing
- Build housing for the refugees
- Harvest resources by building varied infrastructure
- Move resources where they are needed.

You will face several problems:

- The more people are crammed together, the more likely riots emerge
- Without enough resources, people will also riot
- Natural disasters can occur that disrupt comms or destroy infrastructure
- You might need to decide to let some people out to save your residents...

There's a chat function to communicate with other people online.
